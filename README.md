# 📌 LeetCode Company Problems – Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome Extension that helps you quickly browse and practice **LeetCode problems by company**.  
Each company has a dedicated list of questions (loaded from CSV files), so you can focus on the interviews that matter most 🚀.
I invite anyone who wants to update the questions so that it can help others as well!
